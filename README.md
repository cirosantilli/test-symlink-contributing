# test-symlink-contributing

A [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) that is a symlink to see how it shows on the new issue form.

As of 2015-02-01, [the link shows on GitHub](https://github.com/cirosantilli/test-symlink-contributing/issues/new), and is not resolved. This behaviour differs from a `README.md` symlink, which does not show as rendered, and is almost not certainly what users expect.
